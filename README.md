# jQuery.Passwordify.js

This jQuery plugin allows you to turn any input field into a smartphone-style password field. The field will show the character just typed
and then replace it with an asterisk "*" a moment later. The real value of the entered password is stored in an HTML data attribute for
the target element.

This plugin also accepts a callback for when the enter key is pressed. The callback returns the original jQuery object.
